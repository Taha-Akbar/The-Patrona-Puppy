                Dog and puppy vaccinations are basically a training camp for your dog’s immune system. The white blood
                cells in his body will produce proteins (so called antibodies) that will, together with other white
                blood cells, fight the infectious agent (called antigens). It is recommended to top up your dog’s
                vaccinations frequently to make sure his body still has enough of the trained antibodies to be able to
                fight the infectious germs when needed.

                Over the last decade there has been increasing debate about the over-vaccination of pets.
                Depending on the vaccine used and the individual animal, immunity can last significantly
                longer than 12 months. Some pet owners worry about vaccinating their pet whilst its
                immunisation is still sufficient.

                If you want your precious little puppy to grow up to be a well-behaved companion, you need to teach him
                or her some manners, and some basic obedience commands.
                A fair number of puppy FAQs center around puppy behavior, and learning what behavior is acceptable and
                what isn't should be some of his earliest lessons!
                If you want your pup to understand what you expect of him, there are three simple steps that you MUST
                follow : tell your puppy what you want him to do
                help him to perform that behavior
                reward him with treats and/or praise when he is successful Several short training sessions per day are
                much better than one longer one because you want him to enjoy his trainings sessions and think they're a
                fun part of his day.
                The first thing to teach your little one is to recognize his name. After that, the basic obedience
                commands that you want your pup to teach him are "sit", "come" and "down". You can read more about this
                on my Puppy Training Page

                  How Do I Introduce My New Puppy To The Resident Dog?

                Most dogs learn to get along with a newcomer (and some super-sociable souls accept them right away), but
                if your older dog is treating the new baby with something less than unbridled enthusiasm he won't be the
                first to do so!
                When choosing a new dog to integrate into your family, it's best to choose one of the opposite sex to
                the resident dog. Two same-sex dogs are less likely to get along as adults, especially if they're not
                neutered/spayed.
                Also consider size and temperament, an older dog with a high prey drive may not be the best match for a
                puppy from a tiny, fast-moving breed such as the Yorkshire Terrier.
                Make the initial introductions under supervision, and expect some hesitation on the part of either
                pooch.
                Always remember to show lots of affection to your older dog.
                It's sometimes difficult to tear yourself away from an adorable new puppy, but make a point of greeting,
                feeding and petting the older dog first, as it reinforces his status (in both his eyes, and the eyes of
                the new puppy) and helps to maintain a natural transition into the 'pecking order'.
                You can find more detailed information on handling these introductions on my Introducing A New Puppy
                page.
                My Dog Barks & Destroys Stuff When I'm Out - What Do I Do? Does your puppy or dog drive the neighbors
                crazy with his barking and howling? Does he try to remodel your home (maybe by chewing holes in the
                walls/door, or destroying carpets and furniture) while you're out?
                If so, chances are he's suffering from separation anxiety. There are levels of separation anxiety,
                ranging from mild distress to hysteria (on the part of the dog, not you. Although the sight of your
                Persian rug in tatters has the potential to trigger a hysterical reaction!).
                Puppies can be scared for a number of reasons, or experience separation anxiety.
                There are all sorts of treatments for this problem, depending on the level of anxiety, what's triggering
                it and how old he is.
                Everything from simple herbal products, calming CD's, or behavior modification training can work.
                By using one, or a combination of treatments, you should be able to lower your dogs' anxiety levels and
                teach him that it's okay to be left alone for a while, and that you always return.
                To find out more about how you can help your pet overcome his fears and bring peace back to your home,

                Constant licking and/or scratching and red, itchy skin or hair loss are all signs of dog allergies.
                I think it's important to point out in this Puppy FAQs page that dogs suffer from allergies just as
                people do!
                There are many different causes and triggers for dog allergies, but most result in skin problems and a
                variety of allergies
                These include:
                Flea allergy
                Inhalant allergy
                Dog food allergy
                Contact allergy
                There are many, many different ways to treat allergies in dogs, and of course the treatment depends on
                the trigger!

                It's critically important to realize that puppies need to stay with their mother and littermates through
                7 weeks old, at minimum. The 5-7 week period is so vital, being when puppies learn social lessons on how
                to control the intensity of their bite (through play with littermates), how to accept discipline and
                respond to it properly, and how to correctly interpret canine body language.
                Pups placed in homes before going through this stage tend to play-bite harder, and continue the behavior
                further into adolescence, than pups who remain with the litter through 7 weeks old. And, of course, a
                lack of understanding canine body language can lead to a host of problems - inability to play properly,
                fear, over-excitement, or even aggression toward other dogs.
                A further consideration is that 7 weeks is the age when most experienced breeders and animal
                professionals believe that puppy aptitude and temperament testing is the most reliable. So, if your
                breeder is doing one of these tests to help determine which puppy will be best for you, placement would
                be at or after 7 weeks old. That said, oftentimes pups will do better going home somewhat later than 7
                weeks old, provided the breeder is equipped to train and socialize the litter. With my own breed, I find
                9 weeks to be a good age, in that the pups are generally emotionally ready and eager to make the
                transition and to bond to new owners. Some of the smaller breeds can take longer to mature physically,
                and may adjust more easily - and housetrain more readily - when they are placed at 10 or even 12 weeks
                of age.
                Whatever the age, it's important to stress that, if the breeder keeps the pups past 7 weeks old, he or
                she must be committed to taking the time to regularly and thoughtfully introduce each pup individually
                to new sights, sounds, surfaces, people, animals, and places.

                What you feed your puppy now has a direct effect on his future health, growth and development, so it's
                not surprising that I get asked a LOT of questions about diet and puppy food.
                Choose puppy kibble that has the wording 'a complete and balanced diet' on the package. This shows it
                meets the standards set by the AAFCO (Association of American Feed Control Officials).
                You need to be sure the dog food you pick has a good source of high quality protein as it's first
                ingredient. Chicken or Lamb are both good choices.
                Puppies grow very rapidly, and to support that growth they need a diet high in protein, fat, vitamins
                and minerals.
                Protein values should be around 25% plus and fat around 15%. If you have a large breed or small breed
                puppy, look for a puppy food that is especially designed to meet their specific requirements.
                You can see a list of what I consider to be the best puppy foods on the market here - Best Puppy Food
                Choices, also check out my Puppy Food Reviews page.

                Even when potty training is going smoothly, there will be times when your puppy has an 'accident'. It's
                one of those 'puppy FAQs of life'.
                To avoid having your carpets ruined you need to act quickly, and tackle those puddles in the right way.
                To be effective, you need to blot up any liquid that is in your carpet. Then you need to rinse the area
                well with clean, cool water and blot that up too.
                Follow this with an application of an enzymatic-based cleaner/odor remover. Allow this to soak into the
                carpet for at least 10 minutes and then blot up the excess. Allow area to dry thoroughly.
                You may need to repeat this process more than once.
                For more information on how to keep your carpets stain and odor free, and find out which product REALLY
                works, see my Dog Urine Cleaning and Best Dog Urine Cleaning Products pages.

                  Does My Puppy Have Worms & How Do I Treat Them?

                A huge percentage of puppies have worms and if you're a new puppy parent, it's something you may well
                have to deal with.
                Some worms can be seen in your dog's feces, and in severe cases of roundworm infestation your pup may
                even have worms in his vomit. Other symptoms of worm infestation include a round, distended belly, a
                dull, rough coat or a cough.
                Although very common, worms can make your puppy quite sick...at the very least he'll feel and look 'out
                of sorts'.
                You will need your veterinarian to diagnose and confirm the infestation, and the type of worm involved.
                They will then prescribe, or administer, the appropriate de-wormer. Do not use over-the-counter
                medications as they can be ineffective at best, and harmful at worst.
                Heartworms are a different story, but you are unlikely to find these in a young puppy.
                You can learn more about worms, causes, symptoms and treatments on my Puppy Worms page

                  Help - My Puppy Has Diarrhea!

                This is one of those questions where it's not necessarily easy to figure out the answer without
                veterinary help.
                Diarrhea in puppies is very common and can be a sign of a simple tummy upset due to a change in diet for
                example - or a deadly serious illness such as Parvo.
                If your puppy has diarrhea that looks has the consistency of chocolate pudding, but otherwise seems
                okay, chances are he's eaten something he shouldn't.
                If he's not vomiting, is alert, playful and bright-eyed you can probably afford to wait and see for a
                while. BUT if he's not feeling better within 24 hours, or seems to be getting worse, call your
                veterinarian right away.
                If your puppy's diarrhea is severe and watery, he's vomiting and/or seems lethargic, has dull eyes and
                looks like he feel unwell you need to get in touch with your veterinarian right away.
                If it's after hours you should contact your nearest 24 hour emergency pet clinic. This could be a
                life-or-death situation.
                For more detailed information on this common puppy complaint, check out my Puppy Diarrhea page.

                Small-breed pups develop much faster than other breeds of dogs. They have faster metabolic rates and
                need higher levels of protein, fat, calcium, and phosphorus. Meanwhile, large-breed dogs aren't
                considered full grown until they're nearly 2 years old. And while many people think that large breeds
                should eat huge quantities of food, they simply need meals that pack a nutritional punch. (If overfed,
                these animals risk putting on too much weight too quickly and could develop skeletal problems.) The
                scientists at EUKANUBA™ have developed specific formulas for every size puppy so you'll be sure to know
                they've got all the nutrition they need to grow up healthy.

                AAs soon as possible. Many breeders and adoption agencies will have something like a 48-hour guarantee,
                so you want to get it done in that time. But even without that, you still should get the puppy in within
                a day or two. That way, if there’s something wrong, we can catch it early and get it before it becomes a
                big problem.
                It also gives us a chance to talk with owners about what it takes to raise a puppy. We need to talk
                about worms, feeding, vaccinations, the financial aspect of owning a pet, and everything else they can
                expect over the life of their dog.
                The owners should bring in their list of questions, too. You need to ask your vet every question that
                comes to mind. You can’t ask too many questions. Your veterinarian should be willing to block out time
                for that.

                Puppies are like children. They love to learn and they’re inquisitive. And just like with children, you
                have to keep things they can chew on and swallow out of reach. So keep toys away, and don’t leave food
                where they can get to it, especially candy or foods that could make them sick. Keep trash cans secured
                or they will get into them and eat bones and beer bottle tops and other things that are dangerous. I
                can’t tell you how many beer bottle tops I’ve taken out of puppies’ bellies.
                The biggest thing we see in our emergency room with puppies is that they’ve swallowed something. They
                swallow balls, a sock, a piece of a plastic toy. Puppies love to chew on plastic.
